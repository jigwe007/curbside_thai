            <img src="ct_photo1.png" alt="image of server delivering food to customers">

North Carolina. Master Chef Sajja Adulet, with over 35 
years of experience at the House of Asia, now offers

paper boxes! Sample his acclaimed cuisine at our various 
mobile locations throughout downtown Charlotte from 
11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday through Thursday, and 
11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. 
Taste the difference! If you can't get away from your desk, 
<em> Curbside Thai will deliver</em>.</p> 

<p>Contact us to cater your next party and experience 
what <cite>Carolina Traveler</cite> calls <Q>the finest Asian food

        <h1>Reviews</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <p>The culinary art of the food truck vendor has been steadily 
                improving over the last 10 years with fine offerings from 
                Antonio's Italian, Organic on the Road, and now Curbside Thai. 
                Sajja Adulet is to be congratulated for offering delicious 
                and authentic Thai food at a reasonable price. We think 
                Curbside Thai provides the finest Asian food on or off 
                the streets of Charlotte.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Steaming rice with a spicy Asian sauce is common street fare 
                and we all accept its limitations in exchange for the 
                convenience of a quick bite on the run. With Curbside Thai you 
                don't have to compromise. Building on his experience as a 
                master chef at several fine establishments on the East Coast, 
                Sajja Adulet has brought the taste of fine dining to the 
                Food Cart Wars and we couldn't be happier.</p>
